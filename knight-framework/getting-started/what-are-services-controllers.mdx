## **What are services/controllers?**

Services/Controllers are module scripts that serve a specific purpose within your experience. For example, you might have services dedicated to handling the user interface (UI), managing player points, or controlling game-specific logic.

## **Creating a Service**

To create a service, you’ll need to place a new `ModuleScript` in one of the designated Knight service folders based on its purpose:

- **Server-side services**: `Server`
- **Client-side services (aka Controllers)**: `Client`
- **Shared services**: `Shared`

## **Default Functions**

- `Init()`: Called during the initialization phase of the service. This is optional and typically used for setting up any necessary data or connections before the service starts.

  Copy

  ```
  function Knight:Init()
      -- Initialization logic here
  end
  ```
- `Start()`: Called when the service is ready to begin its main functionality. This is also optional and is typically used to start processes like event listeners, timers, etc.

  Copy

  ```
  function Knight:Start()
      -- Start logic here
  end
  ```
- `Update(deltaTime)`: Called every frame. This function is optional and is used for tasks that need to be updated regularly, such as animations or game logic.

  Copy

  ```
  function Knight:Update(deltaTime)
      -- Frame update logic here
  end
  ```

## **Configuration Options**

- `CanStart`, `CanUpdate`, `CanInit`:

  These booleans determine whether the `Start()`, `Update()`, and `Init()` functions will be called.

If you're using a third-party module and don't want Knight to call its default start functions or inject the framework, set `Standalone`to `true`. This will disable the metatable inject and other framework features to ensure it remains Standalone.

### **Priority Startup**

The default priority levels are as follows:

- Internal Services: 4
- Objects: 3
- Services: 2

You can adjust the startup priority by setting `.Priority` to a specific number in the script. Higher priority numbers indicate an earlier startup.

## **Additional Configuration**

Optionally, if you have an instance that has the collection tag "**KNIGHT_IGNORE**" it will be automatically ignored and not inited/imported into the framework
